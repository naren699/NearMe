        Ariankuppam, situated in the Union Territory of Puducherry, India, is a historically significant coastal fishing village located a short distance south of the main Puducherry town. Its importance dates back to ancient times, as it was once a major Roman trading port known as Arikamedu. Archaeological excavations at Arikamedu have unearthed valuable artifacts, including Roman pottery, glass beads, and other trade goods, providing substantial evidence of Indo-Roman maritime trade relations dating back to the early centuries CE. Today, Ariankuppam retains its identity as a fishing village, with a vibrant local culture deeply connected to the sea. The area offers a glimpse into the traditional livelihoods and customs of the coastal communities in the region. While the ancient port of Arikamedu is a significant historical site attracting researchers and those interested in history, the present-day Ariankuppam is a bustling village with its own local charm and character, reflecting a blend of its historical past and its contemporary coastal lifestyle.
