        Auroville, often referred to as the "City of Dawn," is an experimental township located primarily in the Viluppuram district of Tamil Nadu, India, with some parts extending into the Union Territory of Puducherry. Founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfassa, known as "The Mother," and inspired by the vision of Sri Aurobindo, Auroville aims to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony, above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities. 1  At its center stands the Matrimandir, a magnificent golden globe structure dedicated to inner peace and meditation. The township is a unique experiment in human unity, sustainable living, and spiritual exploration, with residents from various nationalities living and working together in diverse fields such as renewable energy, organic farming, education, and arts and culture. Auroville is characterized by its green and serene environment, a testament to its commitment to ecological sustainability and reforestation efforts. It attracts individuals seeking an alternative way of life focused on community, personal growth, and a conscious evolution of humanity. While it functions with its own unique governance and principles, it exists within the legal framework of India and strives to be a model for human integration and global harmony.
