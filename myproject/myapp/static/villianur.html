        Villianur, nestled to the west of the main town of Puducherry, is a significant locale steeped in history, culture, and spirituality. The town is perhaps most renowned for the ancient Thirukameswarar Temple, a prominent Shiva shrine celebrated for its exquisite Dravidian architecture and deep religious importance. The annual Brahmotsavam festival at this temple draws large numbers of devotees, and the adjacent Sannathi Eri, the temple tank, holds its own significance. Adding to the town's spiritual tapestry is the striking Sacred Heart Church, an impressive Roman Catholic edifice showcasing beautiful Gothic design and serving as a vital religious center for the local Christian community. Beyond its religious landmarks, Villianur is characterized by its surrounding agricultural lands, contributing to the regional economy and offering picturesque green landscapes. The presence of various educational institutions underscores its role in fostering growth and learning within the area.
